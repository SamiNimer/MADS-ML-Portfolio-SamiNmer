Model Architecture Optimization for Small Dataset Classification

Image classification on the hymenoptera dataset (ants vs bees) presents a classic small-data challenge with only 120 training and 75 validation images per class. This limited data availability makes the model highly susceptible to overfitting, requiring careful hyperparameter selection.

Research Goal: Systematically investigate how different architectural choices affect model performance and generalization on small datasets, following proper scientific methodology.

Experimental Setup

-Dataset: Hymenoptera (ants/bees) - 240 training, 150 validation samples

-Base Architecture: Simple CNN with configurable layers

-Fixed Parameters: Adam optimizer (lr=0.001), 15 epochs, batch size=32

-Evaluation Metrics: Validation accuracy, overfitting gap, training stability

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hypotheses and Experimental Design

Hypothesis 1: Model Size vs Overfitting. 
Theory: Bias-variance tradeoff suggests smaller models should generalize better on small datasets.

Test: Compare three model sizes:

Small: 2 conv layers, 16 filters

Medium: 3 conv layers, 32 filters

Large: 4 conv layers, 64 filters

Results

Model Size	    Parameters	    Val Accuracy	    Training Time

Small	        ~50K	        88.2%	            45s

Medium	        ~198K	        85.3%	            68s

Large	        ~792K	        82.1%	            112s

Key Findings:

1. Small model achieved highest validation accuracy (88.2%)

2. Overfitting increased dramatically with model size

3. Training time scaled approximately linearly with parameters.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hypothesis 2: Dropout Effectiveness. 
Theory: Dropout prevents feature co-adaptation and reduces overfitting.

Test: Compare models with/without dropout across different sizes.

Expected: Dropout provides greater benefit for larger models.

Results:

Dropout reduced overfitting for all models

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hypothesis 3: Batch Normalization Impact. 
Theory: Batch norm stabilizes training and allows faster convergence.

Test: Compare training with/without batch normalization.

Expected: Batch norm improves training stability and speed.

Results:

Batch norm accelerated convergence by ~33%. Improved final accuracy by 5.1 percentage points. Significantly reduced training loss variance

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Conclusion:

Through systematic hypothesis testing, this expirement demonstrated that for small image classification datasets:

Smaller models generalize better due to reduced overfitting

Dropout is crucial for larger models but beneficial for all

Batch normalization significantly improves training stability and speed

The optimal configuration for our ants/bees dataset was a simple 2-layer CNN with dropout (0.3) and batch normalization, achieving 88.2% validation accuracy with minimal overfitting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

What I Learned:

Theory vs Reality Gap: The bias-variance tradeoff sounded simple in theory, but seeing how dramatically overfitting increases with model size on our small dataset was eye-opening. A 4-layer model performed worse than a 2-layer one despite having more capacity.

Regularization is Crucial: I understood dropout and batch normalization conceptually, but didn't appreciate how essential they are until seeing dropout reduce overfitting by 7% in large models and batch norm cut training time by 33%.

Start Simple: My initial instinct was to build complex models, but the experiments showed that simple often works better. This was counterintuitive but the results proved it.

The Hard Parts:

Translating Theory to Code: Understanding batch normalization in theory was one thing; implementing it in a flexible model architecture was much harder.

Controlling Experiments: Isolating variables was tricky. When testing dropout, I had to ensure everything else stayed identical to see the true effect.

Interpreting Results: Sometimes the results didn't match expectations perfectly, requiring me to think critically about why and adjust my understanding.

Biggest Insight:
The most valuable lesson was that systematic experimentation beats random searching. By forming hypotheses first, I learned why things worked, not just what worked. This deeper understanding will help me make better decisions in future projects, not just copy what others have done.
